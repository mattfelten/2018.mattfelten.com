- I currently work at [ServiceTitan](http://servicetitan.com) building a Design Ops and Design System team.
- I worked at [YouCaring](http://youcaring.com) leading our design system project to increase consistency, collaboration, and speed of designers and front-end developers. [See case study](http://mattfelten.com/work/youcaring/).
- For 5 years, I worked at [DreamHost](http://dreamhost.com) leading the product design and UX team. We did some really cool things to make web hosting more approachable. [See case studies](http://mattfelten.com/work/dreamhost/).
- I was self-employed from 2010 to 2012 and got to work with some really great companies like [Phuse](http://phuse.ca), [Red Bull](http://redbull.com), [MetaLab](http://metalab.co), [LA Clippers](http://metalab.co), and [Elephantik](http://elephantik.com). It was a fun couple of years.
- Prior, I worked at [Silver Lion Design](http://silverliondesign.com), [Evolve Media](http://evolvemedia.com), and [Spoonfactory](http://spoonfactory.com), doing client-service design and web development. I worked on projects for [Best Buy](http://bestbuy.com) and [Toshiba](http://toshiba.com) among a ton of others.
